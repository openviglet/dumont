# Dumont — Improvements & design rationale

> **What this file is:** the *design rationale* (the what & why) for **unshipped**
> Dumont work — the spec behind each backlog item. It is one of the roadmap
> documents; keep them in sync:

> | File | Holds | One line per |
> |---|---|---|
> | [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | **Task status** (single source of truth) — `D##` backlog | task |
> | [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md) | Positioning, moat, the bets, non-goals | — |
> | **IMPROVEMENTS.md** (this file) | Design rationale for active `D##` tasks | — |

**Status legend** (status itself lives in ROADMAP.md): ⏳ partial · 📋 designed · 💭 idea.

**Cross-references** use paths from the repo root; linked code may have moved —
verify against `git ls-files` before acting. This track is cross-repo: the demands
originate from the **cursarei → Viglet** migration and pair with Turing **Block R**
(`turing/2026.1/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` §XIX). See [DOCS_INDEX.md](DOCS_INDEX.md).

## I. The second bet — adoption & trust on top of ingestion

The roadmap's first bet (Tracks A–C) is **ingestion fidelity**: a structured-source
SPI, declarative strategies, schema-as-code grounding, crawler hardening and the
cursarei sidecar→native path. That bet answers *"can Dumont extract this source
correctly?"*.

It does **not** answer the two questions that actually gate value once the framework
exists:

1. **Adoption** — *"how cheaply can someone stand up a new source?"* A declarative
   manifest is only cheap if producing it is cheap. Today that still means a developer
   reading HTML and writing selectors. → **Track D** (D13 AI-assisted inference, D14
   dry-run preview).
2. **Trust** — *"can I rely on what came out, and prove where it came from?"* A
   connector that silently drops fields when a catalog changes layout, with no
   provenance on what it published, is not safe to feed a RAG answer. → **Track E**
   (D15 drift monitoring, D16 provenance).

Track F (semantics — embeddings, entity resolution, reusable taxonomy) is the
**differentiator** that turns the result from "a pipe" into the *Data Exchange*
platform the product name claims: it doesn't just move documents, it makes them
semantically richer and de-duplicated on the way through.

The ordering is deliberate. Tracks A–C are prerequisites; D13/D14 (AI-assisted inference +
dry-run preview) opened the adoption layer, D15 (field-coverage & drift monitoring) made
partial degradation visible and the sidecar→native parity gate (D11) measurable rather than
manual, and D16 (field-level provenance) made every published field traceable — all shipped,
completing the trust track. Track F (semantics) follows the RAG maturity on the Turing side.

## IX. Cross-cutting decisions & restrictions

These constrain every task above:

- **Grounding is non-negotiable, everywhere.** Inference (D13), enrichment, embeddings
  and entity-merge (Track F) may omit, normalize, classify, derive or merge — they may
  **never** fabricate a sourced attribute or fill an absent field with a placeholder.
- **Reuse Turing's LLM surface; do not re-wire models in Dumont.** D13 and the D04/D17
  LLM paths all go through `RestClient` → `TurSummaryAPI` / `ChatModel`, inheriting
  Turing's cache and Global Settings (`llmCacheEnabled`, `llmCacheTtlMs`,
  `llmCacheRegenerate`).
- **The web crawler stays usable unchanged.** Every Track A/D/E/F capability sits *above*
  or *beside* `DumWCPluginProcess` under the same `DumConnectorPlugin` SPI — not a rewrite
  of it.
- **No auto-publish from a model.** Anything an LLM proposes is a draft a human confirms.
- **Additive state, not migrations of meaning.** Conditional-fetch validators (D12),
  coverage history (D15) and provenance (D16) are new state alongside existing checksum
  state — they do not change what a "document" is.

## XLI Structured sources over paged JSON APIs

## XLII Web-crawler hardening (real-world sources)

## XLIII Connector run control

## XLIV Frontend build and lint gates

## XLV Builds from released dependencies

A clean checkout of any Dumont branch must compile from the versions its pom names, as
released on Maven Central, with no sibling Turing checkout or locally installed
snapshot. Downstream images (dumont-ce, viglet.cloud's per-tenant Dumonts) build exactly
that way.

## XLVI API access and credential handling

Who can call the connector API, and what it hands back. The key filter and the security
chain both exempt a small set of probe routes; each exemption is a promise that the
route returns nothing a caller could use to act as Dumont.

## XLVII Adoption & authoring

## XLIX The WordPress connector plugin

### XLIX.83 Releases deployed to the plugin directory (D227)

WordPress.org never reads GitHub: an approved plugin gets its own SVN repository at
`plugins.svn.wordpress.org/viglet-turing-search` (the slug since D273), and what it
holds is the package, not the history. So the monorepo stays the source and no separate
repository is needed; the directory becomes one more target of the `wordpress-v*` tag.

The `release` job in `wordpress-plugin.yml` already builds the `viglet-turing-search/`
folder through `bin/build-zip.sh`, which refuses a tag that disagrees with the plugin
header or the readme's Stable tag. A step after it commits that folder to `trunk/`,
copies it to `tags/<version>`, and sends the directory's banners, icon and screenshots
to `assets/` from a folder kept outside the package.
`10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy` does this from a subfolder through `BUILD_DIR`;
the SVN credentials live in repository secrets.

The first submission is manual and outside this task: a wordpress.org account uploads
the zip, the review team approves it, and only then does SVN exist.

Done when a `wordpress-v*` tag updates the directory listing with no step by hand.

### XLIX.125 The video embedded from YouTube, with its transcript (D282)

**What happens.** D246 shipped with its criterion open: the video is neither attached to
a release nor embedded anywhere. Its plan was to embed the release asset, but GitHub
serves a release asset as a download, not a stream, so a `<video>` pointing at it loads
badly. The video goes to YouTube instead, published by Alexandre on the Viglet channel,
and the plugin's pages embed that.

**What it should do.**
- This site's WordPress page and the plugin's docs page embed the English YouTube video,
  with the transcript (the narration of D278) as text below it: assistants and search read
  text, not video.
- The plugin README carries `story-30s.mp4` (under 1 MB) as an inline player, uploaded
  through GitHub's editor.
- The release workflow attaches `story.mp4`, `story-30s.mp4` and the caption files to the
  plugin release, for anyone who wants the file.
- `src/readme.txt` carries the YouTube link, which the wordpress.org directory embeds once
  the plugin is listed (D227).
- The pt-BR video is linked from the English description and the reverse, and is not
  embedded on the English pages.

**Done when.** The site page and the docs play the English video with captions and show
its transcript, the README plays the 30 s cut, the release carries the files, and the
D246 criterion is met.

### XLIX.152 Grounded people and themes as facets (D310)

**Where it came from.** A client wants visitors to explore it by **person** and
**theme** across its WordPress sites and DSpace repository (one SN site, D303). People
and themes sit in text, not fields, and the repository's author facet mixes "Surname,
Name" with "Name Surname".

**Where the seam is.** Not Dumont's enrichment: the plugin imports straight to Turing,
and Track F's D18 resolves duplicate *records* by canonical key, not name variants.
Turing already declares `TurSNFieldType.NER` and facets `turing_entity_*` at query time
(`TurSolrQueryBuilder.java` 1065), but nothing populates them. Extraction at Turing's
import serves every source alike (this plugin, D314, D315, every connector), so the core
belongs there: a Turing line, filed before this one is built and named as its dep.

**What the Turing half must do** (stated for that line): extract people, themes,
institutions and places from title and text with the site's LLM, each value a span the
source holds (the non-goal "never fabricate"); resolve variants against a per-SN-site
list of canonical names and aliases; cache by content hash; one extraction per changed
document.

**What the plugin does here:**
- Fields maps the `turing_entity_*` facets to labels (`pessoas`, `temas`…) and offers them on the search block;
- Settings edits the alias list and sends it to the SN site;
- the editor panel shows the values extracted for the post, with remove (never add-by-guess).

**Done when:** a seeded post naming a person and a theme is found under both facets, and
an alias resolves to the canonical name.

### XLIX.153 An immersive layout for the instant overlay (D311)

**Where it came from.** A client wants its search "complete and immersive", one
keystroke from anywhere. The instant overlay (D167, `public/overlay.js`) is a flat list
of six results with no type, date, image, answer or zero state; everything richer lives
only on the results page.

**What the plugin should do.** An "immersive" layout for the overlay (setting `overlay_layout: list|immersive`, list stays the default):
- **full screen** on phones, a large panel on desktop, with focus trapped and the background inert;
- **zero state:** recent searches (already in `localStorage`), popular chips (D202) and an editable "Explore" row of links;
- **results grouped by type** in columns or sections ("Events", "Pages", "Books"), each with the mapped card fields (D305) and its own "see all" into the results page filtered to that type;
- **an answer strip** on top for question-like queries (D166), with "Continue in the assistant" (the next line);
- **a preview pane** on desktop for the highlighted result: image, abstract and card fields, so arrows browse without leaving;
- **keyboard first:** arrows across groups, Tab into the preview, Enter opens, Ctrl+Enter opens the results page; announced with `aria-live`;
- the federated set (D303) and fixed filters (D306) honoured.

Same Interactivity store as the search block, so a theme can style it with the same BEM
classes.

**Done when:** axe passes on the open overlay at 390 and 1280px, and a type group's "see
all" lands on the results page with that filter.

### XLIX.154 From the search answer into the assistant and back (D312)

**Where it came from.** On a client's site the search answer (D166) and the Site
assistant (D175) are separate: a visitor who reads the answer to "como funciona a
biblioteca" and wants "and on Saturdays?" must start over. The answer runs its own
`createAnswerController` with its own conversation (`search-block.js` 528); the
assistant runs `createChatController` and cannot be opened with turns already in it. Nor
does an assistant answer citing many documents link to the results page.

**Nothing is missing in Turing.** `ConversationRequest.messages` already becomes the
chat's `history`, and the SDK's chat controller takes `initialMessages`
(`controllers/chat.ts` 257). The gap is the plugin's alone.

**What the plugin should do.**
- **Search → assistant:** under the answer, "Continue in the assistant" opens the assistant (floating or the page's block) seeded through `initialMessages` with the query and the answer as the first exchange. The assistant gains a small open-with-turns API the answer calls.
- **Assistant → search:** when an answer cites more than three documents, or the visitor asks to "see everything", a link opens the results page with the query and, where the citations share a type, that filter.
- **One session** (`TUR_SESSION`) across both, so the answer's helpful signal and the chat's are one trail; prove the cookie is shared rather than assume it.

Same in the overlay and the results page.

**Done when:** a follow-up typed after "Continue in the assistant" is answered with the
first question's context, and an assistant answer with many sources links to the
matching results page.

### XLIX.155 Turing chat flows in the Site assistant (D313)

**Where it came from.** A client wants its site assistant immersive, with guided
conversations built as Turing chat flows: a tour through the school's near-century of
history with choices, and an orientation flow ("I want to study / research / work here")
routing to the right pages. Turing runs flows (`genai/flow`: forms with `select` fields,
slots, flow-select; endpoints `/form-submit`, `/flow-select`, `/slots` in
`TurSNSiteGenAiAPI`), and `@viglet/turing-sdk` exports `postSiteFlowSelect`,
`postSiteFormSubmit`, `fetchSiteChatSlots` and the `TurChat…` response types, with
`submitForm` and `resetFlow` on the chat controller. The plugin's assistant
(`public/assistant.js`) renders only streamed text, citations and the `navigate` tool.

**What the plugin should do.** The assistant renders what a flow sends:
- **choices** as buttons, typed answers still accepted;
- **forms** as native labelled fields with validation, sent through `submitForm` only when the visitor submits;
- **slot prompts** with label and allowed values;
- **cards** for cited documents with the card fields D305 adds, so a history tour shows a photo and its source;
- **a flow menu**: block attribute `flows` offered as starting chips beside the suggested questions;
- **handoff** shown as "a person will answer" when the flow sends one, hidden otherwise.

Each turn is announced, focus moves to the first control, and keyboard-only use is
proven by the a11y specs; pt_BR ships with it.

**Done when:** a seeded two-step flow with a choice and a form runs end to end in the
block, at 390 and 1280px.

### XLIX.173 Foreign types through one negative filter (D334)

**Found by D327.** `Viglet_Dumont_Mapping::discover_foreign()` lists the `type` values
other sources sent under the site key. Turing returns no results for a negative filter
(`fq[]=-source_apps:wordpress`), so the method counts the key's documents minus the
plugin's own and, when any remain, pages the site's documents 100 at a time up to 2,000,
skipping its own. On a site with more documents a foreign type that Turing orders late
is never seen; the docs say so.

**What to build.** Once Turing T1233 honours negative filter queries, ask once with
`fq[]=site_key:<key>&fq[]=-source_apps:<app>` and read the types from that answer (paged
over foreign documents only, or from a facet on `type` if Turing offers one), and drop
the 2,000 ceiling and its note in the docs.

**Done when:** a foreign type present only after the first 2,000 documents is listed in
Fields.

### XLIX.175 Paused answers on every AI surface (D336)

**Found by D332.** A 429 `quota-exhausted` now reads as "Answers are paused for now;
search still works." on the copilot and the search block's answer panel, and the browser
reports it so Health shows the reset date (`isAiPaused`, `reportAiPaused` in
`public/search.js`). The overlay's instant answer (`public/overlay.js`) and the Site
assistant (`public/assistant.js`) still hide or say nothing, and no surface can tell a
visitor when answers come back: the SDK's `TuringHttpError` drops the response body, so
`resetsAt` never reaches the browser (Turing T1234).

**What to build.** The same paused line, from PHP state, on the overlay's answer and the
assistant's reply, with the report; once T1234 ships, read `error.problem.resetsAt` and
say "until <date>" on every surface.

**Done when:** with the quota spent, the overlay and the assistant say answers are
paused until the reset date.

### XLIX.176 Related across siblings through the filter operators (D337)

**Found by D303.** With `sites: all`, the Related block asks Turing's `/search/similar`
for neighbours across this site and its siblings. That endpoint ignores the filter
operators, so `site_key:a` and `site_key:b` together return nothing (Turing T1235). The
block therefore asks unfiltered and keyless for up to 50 rows and keeps the ids whose
prefix is a key in scope (`class-viglet-dumont-related.php`), reading the whole SN site
and losing neighbours past the 50th.

**What to build.** Once T1235 ships, send the scope as the search does (`fq[]` per key
with `fqi.op=OR`, through `Indexer::scope_query()`), keyless through `for_scope()` (a
partition-bound key sees only its own site), and drop the over-fetch and the prefix
filter.

**Done when:** Related with `sites: all` asks `similar` with the scope's filters and
shows a sibling's neighbour that ranks past the 50th in the whole SN site.

## L The documentation area

The end-user documentation moves from vigletdocs into this repository, as an Astro +
Starlight area of dumont-site served at dumont.viglet.org/docs, themed from the design
system, and docs.viglet.org/dumont later redirects to it.

## LI Releases and links match what the site describes

Filed from the portfolio review of 2026-10-30 (visibility repo, estrategia/portfolio.md
and produtos/dumont.md): the release, the names on the files and the links in the README
trail the site and the 2026.3 line.

## LII Academic repositories as sources (DSpace, OAI-PMH)

### LII.1 A DSpace source (D314)

**Where it came from.** A client wants its institutional repository in the unified
search of its WordPress sites (one SN site, D303). Measured 2026-11-04: the repository
runs **DSpace 9.2**, with REST and OAI-PMH under a non-default server path (public, no
key), about two hundred items in six communities, and `deletedRecord=transient`. DSpace
is the default repository of Brazilian universities, and crawling its HTML loses
authors, dates and collections.

**A profile on the OAI-PMH source, not a second harvester.** Every DSpace speaks OAI,
and its `dim` format carries all metadata, deletions and incremental `from` (D315).
D92's JSON machinery is no shortcut here: its incremental mode expires ids by age and
never filters by `lastModified`. This line adds, from REST, what OAI lacks.

**What Dumont should do.** A `dspace` source over D315:
- **metadata** from OAI `dim`: title, `dc.contributor.author` and `.advisor` (multi), `dc.date.issued` (DATE), `dc.type`, `dc.subject`, abstract, language; the handle URL as the document URL;
- **community and collection** as facets by name, resolved once per run through REST;
- **full text** from the TEXT bundle (DSpace's own extraction), else the ORIGINAL PDF through the shared capped extraction; THUMBNAIL as image; the REST base configured;
- **withdrawn, private or embargoed** items deleted, never indexed;
- a site key per source.

Name variants of one author ("Surname, Name" beside "Name Surname") are D310's to
resolve, not this line's.

**Done when:** an item's author, year, community and a sentence of its full text are
searchable, and withdrawing it removes it on the next run.
