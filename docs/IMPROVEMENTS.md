# Dumont — Improvements & design rationale

**Status legend** (status itself lives in ROADMAP.md): ⏳ partial · 📋 designed · 💭 idea.

**Cross-references** use paths from the repo root; linked code may have moved —
verify against `git ls-files` before acting. This track is cross-repo: the demands
originate from the **cursarei → Viglet** migration and pair with Turing **Block R**
(`turing/2026.1/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` §XIX). See [DOCS_INDEX.md](DOCS_INDEX.md).

## I. The second bet — adoption & trust on top of ingestion

The roadmap's first bet (Tracks A–C) is **ingestion fidelity**: a structured-source
SPI, declarative strategies, schema-as-code grounding, crawler hardening and the
cursarei sidecar→native path. That bet answers *"can Dumont extract this source
correctly?"*.

It does **not** answer the two questions that actually gate value once the framework
exists:

1. **Adoption** — *"how cheaply can someone stand up a new source?"* A declarative
   manifest is only cheap if producing it is cheap. Today that still means a developer
   reading HTML and writing selectors. → **Track D** (D13 AI-assisted inference, D14
   dry-run preview).
2. **Trust** — *"can I rely on what came out, and prove where it came from?"* A
   connector that silently drops fields when a catalog changes layout, with no
   provenance on what it published, is not safe to feed a RAG answer. → **Track E**
   (D15 drift monitoring, D16 provenance).

Track F (semantics — embeddings, entity resolution, reusable taxonomy) is the
**differentiator** that turns the result from "a pipe" into the *Data Exchange*
platform the product name claims: it doesn't just move documents, it makes them
semantically richer and de-duplicated on the way through.

The ordering is deliberate. Tracks A–C are prerequisites; D13/D14 (AI-assisted inference +
dry-run preview) opened the adoption layer, D15 (field-coverage & drift monitoring) made
partial degradation visible and the sidecar→native parity gate (D11) measurable rather than
manual, and D16 (field-level provenance) made every published field traceable — all shipped,
completing the trust track. Track F (semantics) follows the RAG maturity on the Turing side.

## IX. Cross-cutting decisions & restrictions

These constrain every task above:

- **Grounding is non-negotiable, everywhere.** Inference (D13), enrichment, embeddings
  and entity-merge (Track F) may omit, normalize, classify, derive or merge — they may
  **never** fabricate a sourced attribute or fill an absent field with a placeholder.
- **Reuse Turing's LLM surface; do not re-wire models in Dumont.** D13 and the D04/D17
  LLM paths all go through `RestClient` → `TurSummaryAPI` / `ChatModel`, inheriting
  Turing's cache and Global Settings (`llmCacheEnabled`, `llmCacheTtlMs`,
  `llmCacheRegenerate`).
- **The web crawler stays usable unchanged.** Every Track A/D/E/F capability sits *above*
  or *beside* `DumWCPluginProcess` under the same `DumConnectorPlugin` SPI — not a rewrite
  of it.
- **No auto-publish from a model.** Anything an LLM proposes is a draft a human confirms.
- **Additive state, not migrations of meaning.** Conditional-fetch validators (D12),
  coverage history (D15) and provenance (D16) are new state alongside existing checksum
  state — they do not change what a "document" is.

## XXXIII A gate that fails for its own startup cost

The lint gates run real tools, which is what makes them worth trusting. It also means
their own cost can be mistaken for the failure they exist to report.

### XXXIII.1 The cold ESLint resolve (D77)

`eslint-gate.test.ts` asserts what the lint config does by running ESLint for real: each
case spawns `eslint.js` with the source on stdin, which is the only honest way to ask
"would this be an error in *this* file". Six cases, six processes.

The first process pays for all of them. It resolves the flat config, loads
typescript-eslint and the two React plugins, and starts the type-aware program. Measured
here: 18.7s, against vitest's default 10s per-test timeout. The suite fails — not on an
assertion, but on the clock.

The failure is worse than a slow test, because of what it fails *as*. A red
`eslint-gate` reads as "the lint gate is broken", which is exactly the alarm D48 built
this file to raise. A gate that cries wolf on a cold runner is one people learn to
re-run rather than read, and CI runners are cold by definition.

Two fixes compose. Give the file a `testTimeout` that reflects what it actually does,
since the cost is inherent to spawning ESLint and not a regression to be caught. And pay
the cold start once in a `beforeAll` warm-up rather than charging it to whichever case
happens to run first, so the per-case timings mean something and the failure, if one
comes, names the case that earned it.
