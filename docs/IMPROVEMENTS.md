# Dumont — Improvements & design rationale

**Status legend** (status itself lives in ROADMAP.md): ⏳ partial · 📋 designed · 💭 idea.

**Cross-references** use paths from the repo root; linked code may have moved —
verify against `git ls-files` before acting. This track is cross-repo: the demands
originate from the **cursarei → Viglet** migration and pair with Turing **Block R**
(`turing/2026.1/docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` §XIX). See [DOCS_INDEX.md](DOCS_INDEX.md).

## I. The second bet — adoption & trust on top of ingestion

The roadmap's first bet (Tracks A–C) is **ingestion fidelity**: a structured-source
SPI, declarative strategies, schema-as-code grounding, crawler hardening and the
cursarei sidecar→native path. That bet answers *"can Dumont extract this source
correctly?"*.

It does **not** answer the two questions that actually gate value once the framework
exists:

1. **Adoption** — *"how cheaply can someone stand up a new source?"* A declarative
   manifest is only cheap if producing it is cheap. Today that still means a developer
   reading HTML and writing selectors. → **Track D** (D13 AI-assisted inference, D14
   dry-run preview).
2. **Trust** — *"can I rely on what came out, and prove where it came from?"* A
   connector that silently drops fields when a catalog changes layout, with no
   provenance on what it published, is not safe to feed a RAG answer. → **Track E**
   (D15 drift monitoring, D16 provenance).

Track F (semantics — embeddings, entity resolution, reusable taxonomy) is the
**differentiator** that turns the result from "a pipe" into the *Data Exchange*
platform the product name claims: it doesn't just move documents, it makes them
semantically richer and de-duplicated on the way through.

The ordering is deliberate. Tracks A–C are prerequisites; D13/D14 (AI-assisted inference +
dry-run preview) opened the adoption layer, D15 (field-coverage & drift monitoring) made
partial degradation visible and the sidecar→native parity gate (D11) measurable rather than
manual, and D16 (field-level provenance) made every published field traceable — all shipped,
completing the trust track. Track F (semantics) follows the RAG maturity on the Turing side.

## IX. Cross-cutting decisions & restrictions

These constrain every task above:

- **Grounding is non-negotiable, everywhere.** Inference (D13), enrichment, embeddings
  and entity-merge (Track F) may omit, normalize, classify, derive or merge — they may
  **never** fabricate a sourced attribute or fill an absent field with a placeholder.
- **Reuse Turing's LLM surface; do not re-wire models in Dumont.** D13 and the D04/D17
  LLM paths all go through `RestClient` → `TurSummaryAPI` / `ChatModel`, inheriting
  Turing's cache and Global Settings (`llmCacheEnabled`, `llmCacheTtlMs`,
  `llmCacheRegenerate`).
- **The web crawler stays usable unchanged.** Every Track A/D/E/F capability sits *above*
  or *beside* `DumWCPluginProcess` under the same `DumConnectorPlugin` SPI — not a rewrite
  of it.
- **No auto-publish from a model.** Anything an LLM proposes is a draft a human confirms.
- **Additive state, not migrations of meaning.** Conditional-fetch validators (D12),
  coverage history (D15) and provenance (D16) are new state alongside existing checksum
  state — they do not change what a "document" is.

## XXVII The half of the trail the queue writes (D71)

D69 fixed the half of the trail the connector writes: a `SENT_TO_QUEUE` row now names
the source that produced the item rather than whoever flushed the buffer. The next row
in the same document's history names nobody at all.

`DumConnectorProcessQueue` files `RECEIVED_AND_SENT_TO_TURING` through the two-argument
`setSuccessStatus`, which builds a `DumLoggingIndexing` with no `source` and no
`transactionId` — not the wrong ones, absent ones. So a reader filtering the indexing
log by source sees a document queued and never sees it delivered, and a reader following
a transaction id sees the run stop at the queue boundary.

The session carries both, and it does not cross that boundary: the JMS message is a
`TurSNJobItems`, and an item carries sites, locale, checksum and a `sourceApps`
attribute holding the *provider* — never the source name. This is not a missed argument
at the call site; there is nothing there to pass.

That makes the design question the task: what travels with a batch. An envelope beside
the items is the obvious shape and the wrong one — D69 established that a drain spans
sessions, so one envelope per message would name the wrong source again. Which leaves it
per item: a reserved attribute the queue reads and the indexing plugins ignore, at the
cost of putting connector bookkeeping inside the payload.

The property to prove is one a test can state without ambiguity: a document's log
history names the same source at every status it passes through.
